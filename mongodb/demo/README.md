# MongoDB App Service
(Previously known as MongoDB Realm)

MongoDB Realm is a powerful mobile and web application development platform provided by MongoDB. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and services for building modern, scalable, and real-time applications.

- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: MongoDB Realm simplifies backend development by providing a fully-managed backend infrastructure. It offers features like data storage, real-time data synchronization, user authentication and authorization, and serverless functions.
- **Realm Database**: Realm Database is a client-side database included in MongoDB Realm. It allows you to store and manipulate data on the device, providing efficient local data access. Changes made to the local database can be automatically synchronized with the backend server when connectivity is available.
- **User Authentication**: MongoDB Realm provides built-in user authentication and authorization capabilities. You can easily add user registration, login, and session management to your applications, ensuring secure access control for your users.
- **Real-time Data Sync**: With MongoDB Realm, you can create real-time collaborative applications with ease. It supports real-time data synchronization between devices, allowing multiple users to interact and see changes in the shared data in real time.
- **Serverless Functions**: MongoDB Realm enables you to write and execute serverless functions. These functions can be triggered by events or API calls and allow you to add custom business logic to your application without managing a separate backend infrastructure.
- **Integration with MongoDB Atlas**: MongoDB Realm seamlessly integrates with MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed database service provided by MongoDB. This integration allows you to leverage the power of MongoDB's document database for storing and querying data in your applications.
- **Cross-platform Support**: MongoDB Realm supports a wide range of platforms, including iOS, Android, web browsers, and Node.js. This enables you to build applications that run consistently across multiple devices and platforms.

MongoDB Realm simplifies the development process by providing a unified platform for backend functionality, data synchronization, user management, and serverless functions. It empowers developers to build modern applications with real-time capabilities and seamless data integration with MongoDB Atlas.

## Getting started

Here are a few steps to get started using MongoDB Realm with a simple React application:

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas: If you haven't already, sign up for MongoDB Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a new cluster. This will serve as the backend database for your application.

2. Create a Realm Application: In the MongoDB Realm console (https://realm.mongodb.com/), create a new Realm application and link it to your MongoDB Atlas cluster. This will establish the connection between your application and the database.

3. Set up Authentication: Configure authentication in MongoDB Realm to allow users to register and log in to your application. You can choose from various authentication providers like email/password, Google, Facebook, etc., depending on your requirements. For this example, we will use an Anonymous authentication provider. The Anonymous authentication provider allows users to log in to your application without providing credentials. Anonymous user objects have a unique ID value but no other metadata fields or configuration options.

4. Set up a Backend Service: Create a backend service in MongoDB Realm to define the server-side functionality of your application. This can include defining custom APIs, serverless functions, and triggers that respond to events or database changes.
